# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.11.7
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Virtual Environment Setup

To isolate the project dependencies, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows, activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
venv/Scripts/activate
```

### Install Required Packages

Install all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Explanation

This project uses a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage dependencies, ensuring that your development environment is clean and contains only the necessary packages. The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of all Python packages required to run this project.

After setting up your virtual environment and activating it, you install all dependencies within this isolated environment, which avoids potential conflicts with different project dependencies. 

Finally, running `main.py` starts the application. Make sure your virtual environment is activated whenever you work on the project to maintain consistency across development setups.
